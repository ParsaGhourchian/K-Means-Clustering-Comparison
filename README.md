# K-Means Clustering Comparison: Raw vs Processed Data

This project demonstrates how data preprocessing impacts clustering performance by comparing KMeans clustering results on raw data and processed (cleaned/transformed) data.
It evaluates clustering quality using the Silhouette Score and visualizes the cluster distributions.

# 📌 Features

KMeans clustering on two datasets

Silhouette Score evaluation for cluster quality

Side-by-side visualization of cluster patterns

Comparison of raw vs processed data performance
